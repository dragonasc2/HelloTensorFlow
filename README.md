# HelloTensorFlow
My learning route on tensorflow.
In this reposity, I will record my path of studying Deep Learning / CNN , with powerful tool TensorFlow.
The major content of this repository are the works I am repeating.
Because I think the best way to learn some skills, is to repeat state-of-the-art works done by other experts.

The following works have already be repeated in this repository:

mnist (by CNN network, or by Fully Connected network)

Iris ( by  tf.esimator, which i copyed from tensorflow's tutorial, or by handwriten Fully Connected network)

SRCNN ( by 3-layers of Convolutional Neurual Network, achiveves the state-of-the-art performance)
